To run the code, provide two arguments:

- Name of the folder for the program search for ascii files;
- Name of the extension to search for.

Example: `./ascii_to_fits.py folder_name .txt`

## File Structure

1. The first column must be wavelength values;
2. and the second one, flux values.


**By default, the code skips the first two lines of the file, be aware of that!**
